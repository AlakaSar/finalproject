  These are the slides to promote this product
  The product is the shiny app that predicts the next word using data provided by Swiftkey.

---

##  What does the app do for you?

#### The app asks the user to select one of the three text types provided in this data
#### Once the text type (Text or Blog or News) is selected from the dropdown,  
#### relevant data is loaded into memory
#### Then app prompts the user to start their sentence
#### you can see the shiny app at https://alaka10.shinyapps.io/swiftkey/

##  Faster, better and easy to use 

### Algorithm
#### Data is loaded only once for each text type. 

#### Using the results of data exploration, average number of words per sentence in each type
#### decides the length of ngram for that type. The words typed by the user are then looked up
#### in this ngram. If user types words that are more than the ngram allows, then another lookup #### is done on the lines read.
###  This algorithm helps in getting the most common sentences quickly
#### Due to memory constraints on the machine, only part of the data is used in this first 
#### prediction, If the combination is not found in the first go around then the 80% of the data #### is used to search for the possible combination of words.

#### This really helps in getting a faster prediction with small amount of resources.

##  Training the app to learn new combinations. 

#### if a combination of given words is not found in the sample set,
#### the app is designed to train itself with the new combination
#### by saving the new tokens in a local text file 

---

## Another way to improve performance 

#### If I can store the token file on amazon's cloud where 
#### file size is not a problem and access it via hadoop, 
#### then this program has no limits in terms of speed and size.
